Rune Clock Specifications Recap
Big Arm (Hour Hand):
Moves through 24 Runes over 24 hours.
12 Day Runes (lower half, 3 o’clock to 9 o’clock, 90° to 270°) during the day (sunrise to sunset).
12 Night Runes (upper half, 9 o’clock to 3 o’clock, 270° to 90°) during the night (sunset to sunrise).
Day and night durations vary based on sunrise and sunset times (e.g., longer days in summer, longer nights in winter).
Each period (day and night) is divided into 12 equal parts (Runes), and the Big Arm moves through each Rune at a rate proportional to the duration of that Rune.
Small Arm (Minute Hand):
Moves through 12 Vedic zodiac signs over a year, each sign spanning 30° (clockwise from 12 o’clock).
Uses Vedic (sidereal) zodiac transitions, not tropical zodiac.
Position within a sign is proportional to days passed since the Sun entered that sign.
Example: Aries (April 14 to May 15), Taurus (May 15 to June 14), etc.
General Requirements:
Works for any location and date.
Fetches sunrise/sunset times and local time for the location.
Updates the clock hands in real-time based on the current time at the location.
Analysis of Current Logic
Helper Functions (locationTime.ts)
getLatLngFromLocation:
Uses OpenStreetMap Nominatim API to fetch coordinates for a location.
Works correctly, returning lat and lng (e.g., Mumbai: lat 19.0760, lng 72.8777).
getLocalTime:
Uses ipgeolocation.io API to fetch the current local time for given coordinates.
Returns time (e.g., "2025-05-06 16:00:00") and gmtOffset in seconds.
Issue: The date_time_txt field is parsed correctly, but the API response format should be verified (e.g., timezone_offset is expected as a string like "5.5" for IST, which is converted to 5.5 * 3600 = 19800 seconds). This works but could fail if the API format changes.
getSunriseSunsetTimes:
Uses sunrise-sunset.org API to fetch sunrise and sunset times.
Returns sunrise and sunset as Date objects in UTC (e.g., "2025-05-06T00:38:00+00:00" for sunrise in Mumbai).
Issue: The returned times are in UTC, but the code doesn’t adjust them to the local timezone (e.g., IST, GMT+5:30). This causes a mismatch when calculating day/night periods.
Rune Calculations (runeCalculations.ts)
getVedicZodiacSign:
Fetches Vedic zodiac sign using VedAstro API, with a fallback to tropical zodiac dates.
Issue: The fallback uses tropical zodiac dates (e.g., Aries: March 21 to April 19), but the Rune Clock requires Vedic zodiac dates (e.g., Aries: April 14 to May 15). This fallback is incorrect.
Issue: The VedAstro API response format is assumed to be { zodiacSign, signEntryDate }, but the actual response is plain text (e.g., "Aries"). This will cause a parsing error (response.json() will fail).
Issue: The entryDate is not used to calculate progress within the zodiac sign, which is needed for accurate Small Arm positioning.
calculateRuneTime:
Big Arm:
Fetches sunrise, sunset, and local time.
Calculates day and night periods in minutes.
Determines if the current time is daytime or nighttime and computes the Big Arm rotation (90° to 270° for day, 270° to 90° for night).
Issue: The sunrise and sunset times are not adjusted to the local timezone, leading to incorrect day/night periods. For example, sunrise at 00:38 UTC should be 06:08 IST (UTC+5:30).
Issue: The Big Arm calculation assumes linear movement through 180°, which is correct, but the lack of timezone adjustment affects accuracy.
Small Arm:
Hardcodes the zodiac sign as "Aries" and calculates progress using dayOfMonth / 30 * 30.
Issue: Completely ignores the getVedicZodiacSign function, making the zodiac sign static ("Aries") regardless of the date.
Issue: The progress calculation (dayOfMonth / 30) is incorrect. It should calculate days since the sign’s entry date, not the day of the month.
Issue: The zodiac order and starting position are not defined (assumes 0° for Aries, but per specification, Aries should be at 60° if starting from 12 o’clock with Aquarius at 0°).
Rune Clock Component (RuneClock.tsx)
Location Handling:
Initializes location from location.state.placeOfBirth (e.g., "Mumbai, India") and updates when the user searches for a new location.
Issue: The useEffect for updating the timezone (getTimeZones) is incomplete and doesn’t reliably set the timezone for rendering the local time.
Time and Zodiac Sign:
Updates the clock every 30 seconds using calculateRuneTime.
Issue: The zodiac sign in the UI is set to "Aries" via useEffect for May 5, 2025, ignoring the calculateRuneTime result (which also hardcodes "Aries").
Issue: The updateRotations effect calls calculateRuneTime with incorrect arguments (hours, minutes, location_), but the function expects only a location parameter.
Clock Hands:
Renders the Big Arm (hourRotation) and Small Arm (minuteRotation) using CSS rotations.
Issue: Due to the errors in calculateRuneTime, the rotations are incorrect.
Issues Summary
Big Arm:
Sunrise and sunset times are not adjusted to the local timezone, leading to incorrect day/night periods.
The logic is otherwise correct but needs timezone correction.
Small Arm:
Hardcodes the zodiac sign as "Aries" and ignores the Vedic zodiac API.
Uses incorrect progress calculation (dayOfMonth instead of days since sign entry).
Doesn’t define the correct zodiac order (clockwise from 12 o’clock, starting with Aquarius at 0°).
General:
VedAstro API response parsing is incorrect.
Timezone handling in the UI is incomplete.
calculateRuneTime is called with incorrect arguments in the component.
Fixes and Updated Logic
We’ll fix the issues in both runeCalculations.ts and RuneClock.tsx to ensure the Rune Clock hands move accurately based on the entered location, date, and time.

Fix 1: Adjust Sunrise/Sunset Times to Local Timezone
Update getSunriseSunsetTimes to adjust UTC times to the local timezone using the gmtOffset from getLocalTime.

Fix 2: Correct Vedic Zodiac Sign Handling
Fix the VedAstro API response parsing (use response.text() instead of response.json()).
Use Vedic zodiac dates in the fallback.
Calculate the Small Arm position using the sign’s entry date and correct zodiac order.
Fix 3: Fix Small Arm Logic
Use getVedicZodiacSign to determine the zodiac sign.
Calculate progress based on days since the sign’s entry date.
Set the zodiac order clockwise from 12 o’clock (Aquarius at 0°, Aries at 60°).
Fix 4: Fix Component Logic
Correct the calculateRuneTime call in RuneClock.tsx.
Ensure the UI displays the correct zodiac sign and time based on calculateRuneTime results.
Fix timezone handling for rendering.

Example Calculation: May 6, 2025, 04:00 PM IST in Mumbai
Let’s verify the updated logic with a specific example:

Location: Mumbai (lat: 19.0760, lng: 72.8777).
Date: May 6, 2025.
Time: 04:00 PM IST (assumed from getLocalTime).
Big Arm
Sunrise: 06:08 AM IST = 368 minutes.
Sunset: 07:02 PM IST = 1142 minutes.
Day Length: 1142 - 368 = 774 minutes.
Night Length: 1440 - 774 = 666 minutes.
Current Time: 04:00 PM IST = 960 minutes.
Daytime: 960 - 368 = 592 minutes into daytime.
Day Progress: 592 ÷ 774 ≈ 0.7647.
Hour Rotation: 90 + (0.7647 * 180) ≈ 227.7°.
Small Arm
Zodiac Sign: Aries (April 14 to May 15, 2025, via VedAstro API).
Entry Date: April 14, 2025.
End Date: May 15, 2025.
Total Days: 31.
Days Passed: May 6 - April 14 = 22 days.
Progress: 22 ÷ 31 ≈ 0.7097.
Sign Index: Aries is at index 2 (Aquarius: 0, Pisces: 1, Aries: 2).
Base Angle: 2 * 30° = 60°.
Progress Angle: 0.7097 * 30° ≈ 21.29°.
Minute Rotation: 60° + 21.29° = 81.29°.
UI Display
Time: "04:00 PM".
Zodiac Sign: "Aries".
Timezone: "GMT+5.5".
The hands move accurately:

Big Arm at 227.7°, near 7 o’clock, slightly toward 8 o’clock.
Small Arm at 81.29°, near 3 o’clock, slightly counterclockwise, reflecting progress in Aries.
Summary of Changes
