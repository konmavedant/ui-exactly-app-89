Key Points About Zodiac Signs and Location
Vedic Zodiac (Sidereal) Used in the Rune Clock:
The Rune Clock uses the Vedic zodiac, which is based on the sidereal system. This system tracks the Sun’s position relative to the fixed stars (constellations).
Sidereal zodiac signs are determined by the actual positions of the constellations in the sky, adjusted for the precession of the equinoxes (a slow wobble of Earth’s axis over ~26,000 years).
In Vedic astrology, the zodiac signs have fixed date ranges that do not vary by location. For example:
Aries: April 14 to May 15.
Taurus: May 15 to June 14.
(And so on for all 12 signs).
These dates are based on the Sun’s transit through the constellations and are the same globally, regardless of where you are on Earth.
Time Zones and Local Date:
While the Vedic zodiac sign itself doesn’t change based on location, the local date does depend on the time zone.
For example, if it’s May 15, 2025, at 1:00 AM in New York (UTC-4), it’s already May 15, 2025, at 11:00 AM in Tokyo (UTC+9). Both locations are on the same calendar date, so the zodiac sign (Taurus, starting May 15) is the same.
However, if it’s May 14, 2025, at 11:00 PM in Los Angeles (UTC-7), it’s May 15, 2025, at 2:00 AM in London (UTC+1). In this case:
Los Angeles is still in Aries (May 14).
London has moved to Taurus (May 15).
The zodiac sign depends on the local date, which is affected by the time zone. But this is a matter of timing, not a fundamental difference in the zodiac sign itself.
Sidereal vs. Tropical Zodiac:
In contrast, the tropical zodiac (used in Western astrology) is based on the seasons and the equinoxes, not the fixed stars. Tropical zodiac dates are fixed to the equinoxes (e.g., Aries starts at the spring equinox, around March 21).
Because the tropical zodiac is tied to the Earth’s tilt and orbit, it also doesn’t vary by location—it’s the same everywhere.
However, the sidereal zodiac (Vedic) and tropical zodiac differ from each other due to precession. For example, on May 6, 2025:
Vedic (sidereal): Aries (April 14 to May 15).
Tropical: Taurus (April 20 to May 20).
This difference is global and not location-specific.
Astronomical Consistency Across Locations:
The Sun’s position in the sky (and thus its zodiac sign in the sidereal system) is an astronomical fact that doesn’t change based on where you are on Earth.
At any given moment, the Sun is in the same position relative to the stars, whether you’re in New York, Tokyo, or Mumbai. Therefore, the Vedic zodiac sign is the same everywhere at the same universal time (e.g., UTC).
The only variation comes from time zones affecting the local date, as mentioned above.
Rune Clock Context:
The Small Arm of the Rune Clock tracks the Sun’s position in the Vedic zodiac over the year.
The logic fetches the local date in the location’s time zone to determine the zodiac sign and the progress within that sign (e.g., days passed since the sign’s start date).
For example, if the local date in one location is May 14 (Aries), but in another location it’s May 15 (Taurus) due to time zone differences, the Small Arm will reflect the respective zodiac sign for each location.
However, this is not because the zodiac sign itself differs by location—it’s because the local date differs due to time zones.
How the Rune Clock Handles This
Small Arm Logic:
The Small Arm’s position depends on the Vedic zodiac sign, which is determined by the local date in the location’s time zone.
The Vedic zodiac dates are fixed globally (e.g., Aries from April 14 to May 15), so the sign itself doesn’t vary by location.
The logic ensures the correct local date is used:
Fetch the current local date and time for the location.
Use the local date to determine the Vedic zodiac sign and calculate the Small Arm’s angle (based on progress within the sign).
If two locations are on different dates due to time zones (e.g., May 14 vs. May 15), they might show different zodiac signs at the same universal moment, but this is a time zone effect, not a location-based difference in the zodiac.
Big Arm Logic:
The Big Arm’s movement depends on local sunrise, sunset, and current time, which are all adjusted to the location’s time zone.
This ensures the Big Arm reflects the correct local time of day, but it doesn’t affect the zodiac sign calculation for the Small Arm.
Conclusion
The zodiac sign (in the Vedic sidereal system) is not different in different locations at the same universal time (e.g., UTC). The Sun’s position in the sky is the same everywhere on Earth at any given moment.
However, time zones can cause the local date to differ between locations, which may result in different zodiac signs being active at the same universal moment. For example:
If it’s May 14, 23:00 in one time zone (Aries), it might be May 15, 01:00 in another (Taurus).
This is not a difference in the zodiac sign itself—it’s a difference in the local date due to time zones.
The Rune Clock accounts for this by always using the local date in the location’s time zone to determine the Vedic zodiac sign for the Small Arm, ensuring the correct sign and position are displayed regardless of the location.
