Let’s evaluate the Rune Clock in the image for 03:32 PM in Mumbai on May 5, 2025, considering the personal details: Name: Vedant, Date of Birth (DOB): April 24, 2024, and Place of Birth: Mumbai, Asia. We’ll calculate the correct positions of the Big Arm (daily movement) and Small Arm (yearly movement) and check the zodiac sign, ensuring the calculations align with the rules provided.

Step 1: Big Arm Placement (Daily Movement)
The Big Arm moves through 24 Runes (12 Day Runes from 3 o’clock to 9 o’clock, 12 Night Runes from 9 o’clock to 3 o’clock), with day and night periods divided into 12 equal parts each. It extends to the external circle. The Big Arm’s position is based on the current time and location, not the DOB.

Sunrise and Sunset Times for Mumbai on May 5, 2025
From previous calculations (using timeanddate.com data):

Sunrise: 06:09 AM IST
Sunset: 07:01 PM IST
Day and Night Lengths
Day Length (06:09 AM to 07:01 PM): 12 hours 52 minutes = 772 minutes.
Night Length (07:01 PM to 06:09 AM next day): 11 hours 8 minutes = 668 minutes.
Divide Day and Night into 12 Equal Parts
Day: 772 minutes ÷ 12 = 64.33 minutes per Day Rune (approximately 64 minutes 20 seconds).
Night: 668 minutes ÷ 12 = 55.67 minutes per Night Rune (approximately 55 minutes 40 seconds).
Big Arm Position at 03:32 PM
Since 03:32 PM is during the day:

Time elapsed since Sunrise:
From 06:09 AM to 03:32 PM:
06:09 AM to 03:09 PM = 9 hours = 540 minutes.
03:09 PM to 03:32 PM = 23 minutes.
Total: 540 minutes + 23 minutes = 563 minutes.
Number of Day Runes passed:
563 minutes ÷ 64.33 minutes per Rune = 8.75 Runes.
The Big Arm has passed 8 full Day Runes and is 75% through the 9th Day Rune.
Positioning the Big Arm
The 12 Day Runes span from 3 o’clock (90°) to 9 o’clock (270°), covering 180°.
Each Day Rune spans 180° ÷ 12 = 15°.
After 8 Runes: 8 × 15° = 120°. Starting from 90° (3 o’clock), this is 90° + 120° = 210°.
Additional 0.75 of a Rune: 0.75 × 15° = 11.25°.
Total angle: 210° + 11.25° = 221.25°.
The Big Arm should be at approximately 221.25°, which is past the 7 o’clock position (210°), moving toward the 8 o’clock position (240°), extending to the external circle.

Big Arm in the Image
In the image, the Big Arm (longer hand) is pointing toward the “Mid-night” mark, around the 12 o’clock position (0°). This does not match the calculated position of 221.25°, so the Big Arm is incorrectly placed.

Step 2: Small Arm Placement (Yearly Movement)
The Small Arm moves through the 12 Zodiac signs (each spanning 2 Runes), staying in each sign for about 30 days, extending to the circle bordering the Runes and Zodiac signs. The Small Arm’s position should reflect the zodiac sign on the current date (May 5, 2025), not the DOB.

Zodiac Transitions for the Current Date
From previous calculations (using drikpanchang.com data):

April 14, 2025: Sun enters Aries.
May 15, 2025: Sun enters Taurus.
On May 5, 2025, the Sun is in Aries:

Duration in Aries: April 14 to May 15 = 31 days.
Time elapsed in Aries by May 5: April 14 to May 5 = 21 days.
Fraction of Aries completed: 21 days ÷ 31 days = 0.677 (67.7%).
Positioning the Small Arm
Each Zodiac sign spans 360° ÷ 12 = 30°.
Aries starts at 12 o’clock (0°).
67.7% of 30° = 0.677 × 30° = 20.31°.
The Small Arm should be at 20.31°, about 2/3 through Aries, near the 12 o’clock position.
Small Arm in the Image
In the image, the Small Arm (shorter hand) is pointing toward the “Spring” section, around the 3-4 o’clock position (90°-120°), which aligns with Gemini or Cancer, not Aries. The Small Arm is incorrectly placed.

Step 3: Evaluate the Zodiac Sign
The zodiac sign in the image is labeled as Aries. Let’s verify:

Based on Current Date (May 5, 2025): The Sun is in Aries (April 14 to May 15), so Aries is correct.
Based on DOB (April 24, 2024):
April 14, 2024: Sun enters Aries.
May 15, 2024: Sun enters Taurus.
On April 24, 2024, the Sun is in Aries, so the DOB also aligns with Aries.
The zodiac sign in the image (Aries) is correct, whether based on the current date or the DOB.

Step 4: Evaluate the Time
The time shown is 03:32 PM, which is 16 minutes later than the previous image (03:16 PM). The Big Arm should have moved clockwise from its position at 03:16 PM (217.5°) to 221.25°, but it’s still at 0°, which is incorrect.

Conclusion: Is the Placement of Rune Clock Hands and Zodiac Sign Correct?
Big Arm: Should be at 221.25° (past 7 o’clock, toward 8 o’clock), but it’s at 0° (12 o’clock). Incorrect.
Small Arm: Should be at 20.31° (2/3 through Aries, near 12 o’clock), but it’s at 90°-120° (3-4 o’clock). Incorrect.
Zodiac Sign: Labeled as Aries, which is correct for both the current date (May 5, 2025) and the DOB (April 24, 2024). Correct.
The placement of the Rune Clock hands is not correct, but the zodiac sign is correct. The Big Arm should be adjusted to 221.25°, and the Small Arm to 20.31°. The updated calculation logic provided earlier should help achieve these correct hand placements.
