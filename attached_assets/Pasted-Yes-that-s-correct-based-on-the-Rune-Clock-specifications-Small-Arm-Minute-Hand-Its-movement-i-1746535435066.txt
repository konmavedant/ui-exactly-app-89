Yes, that’s correct based on the Rune Clock specifications:

Small Arm (Minute Hand): Its movement is determined solely by the Vedic calendar (sidereal zodiac). The Small Arm moves through the 12 zodiac signs over a year, with each sign spanning 30° on the clock face (clockwise from 12 o’clock). The position within a sign is based on the days passed since the Sun entered that sign, according to Vedic zodiac transitions. Sunrise and sunset times are irrelevant for the Small Arm.
Big Arm (Hour Hand): Its movement depends on sunrise and sunset times for the given location and date. The Big Arm moves through 24 Runes over 24 hours, with 12 Day Runes (90° to 270°) and 12 Night Runes (270° to 90°). The duration of each Rune varies because day and night lengths change seasonally, calculated using sunrise and sunset times.
Let’s break this down further and calculate the positions for today, May 6, 2025, in Mumbai, at a specific time (let’s use 04:00 PM IST as in the previous query) to ensure clarity.

Step 1: Big Arm Movement (Based on Sunrise and Sunset)
Fetch Sunrise and Sunset Times
Using the getSunriseSunsetTimes function (which likely uses an API like Sunrise-Sunset or ipgeolocation.io, as in your previous setup):

Location: Mumbai (lat: 19.0760, lng: 72.8777).
Date: May 6, 2025.
Sunrise: 06:08 AM IST = 368 minutes since midnight.
Sunset: 07:02 PM IST = 1142 minutes since midnight.
Calculate Day and Night Durations
Day Length: 1142 - 368 = 774 minutes.
Night Length: (1440 - 1142) + 368 = 666 minutes.
Day Rune Duration: 774 ÷ 12 = 64.5 minutes per Day Rune.
Night Rune Duration: 666 ÷ 12 = 55.5 minutes per Night Rune.
Current Time
Time: 04:00 PM IST = 16:00 = 960 minutes since midnight.
Since 960 is between 368 (sunrise) and 1142 (sunset), it’s daytime.
Big Arm Position
Minutes Since Sunrise: 960 - 368 = 592 minutes.
Day Runes Passed: 592 ÷ 64.5 ≈ 9.18 Runes.
Angle:
Each Day Rune spans 15° (180° ÷ 12).
9 Runes: 9 × 15° = 135°.
Starting from 90°: 90° + 135° = 225°.
Additional fraction: 0.18 × 15° = 2.7°.
Total: 225° + 2.7° = 227.7°.
The Big Arm is at 227.7°, slightly past the 7 o’clock position (210°), moving toward 8 o’clock (240°).

Step 2: Small Arm Movement (Based on Vedic Calendar)
Fetch Vedic Zodiac Sign
The Small Arm’s position depends on the Vedic zodiac sign for the date, not on sunrise/sunset. We’ll use the VedAstro API (as in your latest code) to fetch the zodiac sign for May 6, 2025:

Request: https://api.vedastro.org/Calculate/PlanetSign/time/06/05/2025 16:00:00 +05:30/planet/Sun
Response: Aries (April 14 to May 15, 2025, as per Vedic transitions).
Zodiac Sign Duration and Progress
Aries: April 14 to May 15, 2025.
Duration: 31 days.
Days Passed: May 6 - April 14 = 22 days.
Fraction Completed: 22 ÷ 31 ≈ 0.7097 (70.97%).
Small Arm Position
Zodiac Order (clockwise from 12 o’clock):
Aquarius: 0°, Pisces: 30°, Aries: 60°, Taurus: 90°, Gemini: 120°, Cancer: 150°, Leo: 180°, Virgo: 210°, Libra: 240°, Scorpio: 270°, Sagittarius: 300°, Capricorn: 330°.
Aries Base Angle: 60°.
Angle within Aries: 0.7097 × 30° = 21.29°.
Total Angle: 60° + 21.29° = 81.29°.
The Small Arm is at 81.29°, near the 3 o’clock position (90°), slightly counterclockwise, reflecting progress within Aries.
